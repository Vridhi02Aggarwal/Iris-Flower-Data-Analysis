# Iris-Flower-Data-Analysis
This machine learning project aims to classify iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on measurements of their petals and sepals. The dataset consists of 150 samples and is widely used as a beginner-friendly dataset for classification problems.

## **Project Goals:**
- Build a classification model to predict iris species based on feature measurements.
- Identify important features using feature importance scores.
- Visualize the decision boundaries and data distribution in 2D and 3D.
- Evaluate the model performance using metrics and visualization techniques.
- Create an interactive and well-documented ML pipeline.

## Dataset Overview:
The dataset consists of 5 columns:
1. sepal length (cm)
2. sepal width (cm)
3. petal length (cm)
4. petal width (cm)
5. species (target variable)

## **Visualizations:**
- Correlation Heatmap: Shows relationships between features.

- 3D Scatter Plot: Visualizes the dataset in 3D space for intuitive understanding.

## **Libraries Used:**
- pandas and numpy – data handling
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly – visualizations
- scikit-learn – ML model building and evaluation
- mlxtend – for plotting decision regions

## **Terminologies Used:**
1. Feature: 	An individual measurable property of the data (e.g., petal length).
2. Target/Label: 	The output variable the model predicts (species name).
3. Classification : 	A type of supervised learning where the model predicts a category.
4. Train/Test Split: 	Dividing data to train the model and evaluate performance.
5. Random Forest: 	An ensemble ML model using many decision trees for classification.
6. Feature Importance: Indicates how valuable each feature is in predicting the target.
7. Decision Boundary: 	A line (or surface) that separates different classes in feature space.
8. Label Encoding: 	Converting categorical values into numeric codes.
9. Confusion Matrix: 	A table to evaluate classification accuracy by showing true vs. predicted labels.
10. Classification Report: 	A summary of precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
